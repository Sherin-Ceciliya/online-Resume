            Harry's character undergoes significant development as he faces numerous challenges and matures throughout the series.
            He learns about the complexities of the wizarding world, the importance of friendship, and the sacrifices necessary to stand up against evil.

        <p>Draco is initially portrayed as a snobbish, prejudiced, and elitist character who looks down upon Muggle-born wizards and witches.
            He is a member of a group of students known as "Slytherin House," which is known for its ambition, cunning, and sometimes dark tendencies.
            Draco is raised with certain expectations by his family, particularly his father Lucius Malfoy, to uphold pure-blood wizarding traditions and values.
            Despite his initial negative traits, Draco also exhibits vulnerability, fear, and internal conflict, especially as he becomes more deeply involved with the darker aspects of the wizarding world.
            Draco's character becomes more complex, and readers gain insight into his inner turmoil and the pressures he faces from his family and Voldemort.
            He is torn between following his family's expectations and his growing doubts about the path he's chosen.

    <li><b>Dobby the Elf</b>

        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRjqIj7JcG8x7zG4JugkpneVoIUMa279a-HGw&usqp=CAU" height="300" alt="Picture of Dobby the elf"/>
        <p>
            Dobby is introduced in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" as the house-elf serving the Malfoy family, particularly Lucius Malfoy.
            He is initially seen as a quirky and eccentric character, but his actions quickly reveal his selflessness and concern for Harry Potter's safety.
            Dobby's pivotal role in the second book involves trying to protect Harry by warning him of the dangers at Hogwarts and later helping him escape from the Malfoy Manor.
            In "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Dobby is freed from servitude by a sock presented to him as a gift by Harry, and he goes on to work at Hogwarts and other places as a paid house-elf.
            Dobby's character evolves from a timid and subservient house-elf to a symbol of liberation and freedom.
            His transformation is emblematic of the broader theme of the mistreatment and enslavement of house-elves in the wizarding world.
